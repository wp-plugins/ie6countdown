== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There is already a plugin that does this, why did you make this one? =

Primarily because the one that currently requires the theme to be modified. I simply did not understand why use a plugin which modifies the theme instead of adding the code straight to your theme? I developed this plugin for WPCloud.net users and am sharing it publicly. For those who run multi-site installs you do not have the convenience of editing the themes that are available. This plugin takes that into consideration.

= What is WPCloud.net? =

WPCloud.net is a WordPress cloud hosting platform which offers cheap managed WordPress hosting in a modified multi-site type environment. This is powered by Rackspace Cloud servers and scales on demand.
